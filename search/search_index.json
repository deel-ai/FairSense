The paper Fairness seen as Global Sensitivity Analysis bridges the gap between global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and fairness. It states that for each sensitivity analysis, there is a fairness measure, and vice-versa. @misc{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2103.04613, doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.2103.04613}, url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04613}, author = {B\u00e9nesse, Cl\u00e9ment and Gamboa, Fabrice and Loubes, Jean-Michel and Boissin, Thibaut}, keywords = {Statistics Theory (math.ST), Methodology (stat.ME), FOS: Mathematics, FOS: Mathematics, FOS: Computer and information sciences, FOS: Computer and information sciences}, title = {Fairness seen as Global Sensitivity Analysis}, This library is a toolbox which ease the computation of fairness and GSA indices. \ud83d\udc49 The problem \u00b6 Each index has it's characteristics: some can be applied on continuous variables and some cannot. Some can handle regression problems and some handle classification problems. Some can handle variable groups and some cannot. Finally some can only be applied on the predictions of a model while some can be applied on the error made by the model. The objective is then to provide a tool to investigate the fairness of an ML problem by computing the GSA indices while avoiding the aforementioned issues. \ud83d\ude80 The strategy \u00b6 The library allows to formulate a fairness problem which is stated as following: a dataset describing the training distribution a model which can be a function or a machine learning model a fairness objective which indicate what should be studied : one can study the intrinsic bias of a dataset, or the bias of the model or the bias of the model's errors These elements are encapsulated in an object called IndicesInput . Then it becomes possible to compute GSA indices (in a interchangeable way) using the functions provided in fairsense.indices . These functions output IndicesOutput objects that encapsulate the values of the indices. These results can finally be visualized with the functions available in the fairsense.visualization module. \ud83d\udcbb install fairsense \u00b6 \u200dfor users \u00b6 pip install fairsense for developpers \u00b6 After cloning the repository pip install -e .

From opening a bug report to creating a pull request: every contribution is appreciated and welcome. If you're planning to implement a new feature or change the api please create an issue first . This way we can ensure that your precious work is not in vain. Setup with make \u00b6 Clone the repo git clone https://github.com/deel-ai/FairSense.git . Go to your freshly downloaded repo cd FairSense Create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies for development: make prepare-dev && source fairsense/bin/activate . Welcome to the team ! Tests \u00b6 To run test make test This command activate your virtual environment and launch the tox command. tox on the otherhand will do the following: - run pytest on the tests folder with python 3.6, python 3.7 and python 3.8 Note: If you do not have those 3 interpreters the tests would be only performs with your current interpreter - run pylint on the deel-datasets main files, also with python 3.6, python 3.7 and python 3.8 Note: It is possible that pylint throw false-positive errors. If the linting test failed please check first pylint output to point out the reasons. Please, make sure you run all the tests at least once before opening a pull request. A word toward Pylint for those that don't know it: Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions. Basically, it will check that your code follow a certain number of convention. Any Pull Request will go through a Github workflow ensuring that your code respect the Pylint conventions (most of them at least). Submitting Changes \u00b6 After getting some feedback, push to your fork and submit a pull request. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives, but for small changes your pull request should be accepted quickly (see Governance policy ). Something that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted: Write tests and ensure that the existing ones pass. If make test is succesful, you have fair chances to pass the CI workflows (linting and test) Follow the existing coding style and run make check_all to check all files format. Write a good commit message (we follow a lowercase convention). For a major fix/feature make sure your PR has an issue and if it doesn't, please create one.
